# Handwritten Digit Generator (MNIST Style)

This project is a web app that generates images of handwritten digits (0–9) in the style of the MNIST dataset. The app is powered by a Conditional GAN (cGAN) model trained from scratch on MNIST using PyTorch.

## Features

- Select any digit (0–9) to generate.
- Generate and display 5 diverse images for the chosen digit.
- Web interface powered by Streamlit for easy use.

## Demo
